This experiment models data of an infrastructure network based on NML (Network Markup Language) and imports into Neo4j graph database.
It was generated 4 differents sizes (10, 100, 1,000 and 10,000 nodes) by [BRITE] (http://www.cs.bu.edu/brite/ "Topology Generator")

## Brief Description of The Files

/topologies - nodes and connections files generated by BRITE

/NMLExperiment - Java codes used to insert the topology in the Graph Database (Neo4j) 

/outputs - results files with the time of each query

/analysis - files with the statitics data extracted of the outputs
