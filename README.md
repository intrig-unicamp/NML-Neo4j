# NML-Neo4j

This experiment models data of an infrastructure network based on NML (Network Markup Language) and imports into Neo4j graph database.
It was generated 4 differents sizes (10, 100, 1,000 and 10,000 nodes) by [BRITE] (http://www.cs.bu.edu/brite/ "Topology Generator"), this topology was insert in the Neo4j, using the model NML.
Toward to evaluate the performance, some queries were created in Cypher Language to ask primitives of the topology.
Each query was executed many times and its time was stored and analized.

## Brief Description of The Files

/topology - nodes and connections files generated by BRITE for each topology

/NMLExperiment - Java codes used to insert the topology in the Graph Database (Neo4j) and to run the queries

/outputs - results files with the time of each query

/analysis - files with the statitics data extracted of the outputs
